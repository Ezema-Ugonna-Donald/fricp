# D-Zie Tech CMS

This here is an implementation of an ongoing research championed by Pello Inc for ZitaVerse, Aunt-related firms. It is an engine that can hold Phaser 3 and ThreeJS thus far.
The framework is inspired by a @BradTravesy Udemy Course Project.

We mutated the project for applications and have already kicked off JavaScript frameworks with similar concept.

Feel free to fork or clone. Go crazy!!!
